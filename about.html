       	  <h3>Foundations</h3>
		  <p>I used to be apart of multiple communities that were very popular. Unfortunatley for those two communitys things went down hill FAST.
Alot of people started leaving the servers and never coming back. I was very confused at how this was happening considering the servers were amazing and very active.
Well after numerous failed attempts of me starting my own server (I didn't know what i was doing)  I finally gave up. I joined one last community and I had high hopes they had all of the right tools and members.
Well guess what the same exact thing happened. Except the members stayed it just got toxic and went to shit. I got sick of this so I met up with my buddy Resistant and threw around a couple of ideas. 
We both agreed to work together and make a community were the players come first. I have always wanted a popular community were people can feel welcome and just have loads of fun. The other communitys I was apart of the Owners or Co-Owners were never apart of there own community.
This was the issue, all of them had the right players and tools, but they were to worried about donations and player count. They never put there own players into consideration.
I have always believed when you make a community the players need to come first. When you open servers or ad addons, ask the players what there thoughts are.
So me and resistant started small. We had a free website, one server (DarkRP) and a 20 slot Teamspeak. People started joining fast. I then decided to open up a Deathrun server.
After that I learned about Managed Machines. I purchased one not really knowing about them and it was an AMAZING decision. I then opened up 6 servers (TTT, Prophunt, DarkRP, Deathrun, Factions, and Prison). 
Ever since we opened these servers I have made sure everyone knows how appreciated there work is and how much it means to me and Summit Gaming. This community isn't mine it is ours. This community wouldn't be what it is without all of you.
I thrive to make this community the best community out there for ALL ages. Gaming should be a way to escape reality to join servers were you are loved and accepted as the gamer we all are. Summit Gaming will provide that as well.
Here at Summit Gaming the players come first and always first. Thank you all for your dedication, Hard Work, and love for Summit Gaming. Remember Summit Wouldn't exist without you guys and gals. Thank you. - BankShot</p>
